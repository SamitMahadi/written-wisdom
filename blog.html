                <p class="card-text"><span class="h5">1.let:</span> The let keyword declares a block-scoped local
                    variable,
                    optionally
                    initializing it to a value.
                    Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is
                    usually denoted by curly braces {}. <br>

                    <span class="h5">2.var:</span> The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable,
                    optionally
                    initializing it to a
                    value.
                    Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in.
                    Global variables are available throughout your entire code. <br>
                    <span class="h5">3.const:</span> The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant
                    variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned.
                    Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are
                    actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.

                <p>
                    An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature introduced in ES6
                    that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Both regular JavaScript functions
                    and arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are some differences between them. Let's see
                    the differences below: -

                    1.Syntax
                    2.Arguments binding
                    3. Use of this keyword
                    4.Using a new keyword

                </p>

                <p class="card-text">Template literals are enclosed by backtick (`) characters instead of double or
                    single quotes. Along with having normal strings, template literals can also contain other parts
                    called placeholders, which are embedded expressions delimited by a dollar sign and curly braces:
                    ${expression}. The strings and placeholders get passed to a function — either a default function, or
                    a function you supply. The default function (when you don't supply your own) just performs string
                    interpolation to do substitution of the placeholders and then concatenate the parts into a single
                    string. To supply a function of your own, precede the template literal with a function name; the
                    result is called a tagged template. In that case, the template literal is passed to your tag
                    function, where you can then perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the
                    template literal.
